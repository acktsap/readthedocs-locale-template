### Localication

[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/) provides free hosting for open-source project. For multi-language project, you need translation project for each language. For example, if you have 2 languages (english as base, korean as translation). You have to make two projet.

- {project_name}
- {project_name}_ko

Set language for each project in `Admin -> Settings -> language`
